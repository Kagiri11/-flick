# FLICK
ðŸŽ¬Flick is
an Android app that consumes the TMDB API to get details about upcoming movies, popular movies, top rated movies and shows in general. This app has been built using Kotlin as the base programming language. While building Flick, I am trying to follow the MVVM architecture.

## Why I created this repo:
        1. To understand how to use retrofit to consume an API.
        2. To solidify my knowledge on the MVVM architecture.
        3. Get to use some of the android jetpack components.
